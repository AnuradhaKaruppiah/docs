NetQ enables you to monitor your network by viewing performance and configuration data about your individual network devices and the entire fabric networkwide. The topics contained in this section describe monitoring tasks for layer 3 protocols across the entire network. For device-specific monitoring refer to {{<link title="Monitor Devices">}}.

NetQ provides monitoring for IP (internet protocol), BGP (border gateway protocol) and OSPF (open shortest path first) network layer protocols. For information about how to configure these in your network, refer to the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/" text="Cumulus Linux Layer 3">}} topics. For details about monitoring these protocols, continue with the topics here.
