When you discover operational anomalies, you can validate that the devices, hosts, network protocols and services are operating as expected. You can also compare the current operation with past operation. The topics in this section provide instructions for validating:

- Switches and hosts
- Physical, data link, network, and application layer protocols and services
- Overlay network protocols

Refer to {{<link title="Manage Configurations">}} and {{<link title="Monitor Operations">}} for tasks related to configuring and monitoring devices and network operations.
