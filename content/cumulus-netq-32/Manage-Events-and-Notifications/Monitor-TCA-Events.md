NetQ offers multiple ways to view your event status. The NetQ UI provides a graphical and tabular view and the NetQ CLI provides a tabular view of threshold-based events. These events are system-related events associated with digital optics, ACL and forwarding resources, interface statistics, resource utilization, and sensors. The difference from the standard system events is that you can set the threshold for when the events are triggered. You can view all events across the entire network or all events on a device. For each of these, you can filter your view of system events based on event type, severity, and time frame.

Refer to {{<link title="Configure Notifications" text="Configure Notifications">}} for information about configuring and managing these events.
