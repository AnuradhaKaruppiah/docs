<td>If you configure aggregate-address &amp;lt;address&amp;gt; summary-only before a component of the same aggregate is injected into the BGP table with the network or redistribute command, when you remove the aggregate-address configuration, the component stays suppressed; it is not advertised to peers. For example:&lt;br/&gt;
Existing configuration:

router bgp 1
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only
 exit-address-family


If you add network 50.0.0.1/32, you see the following (expected) BGP table entries:

Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, &amp;gt; best, = multipath,
              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed

Removing aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only at this point results in the following (unexpected) BGP table entry:

Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, &amp;gt; best, = multipath,
              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed

Vulnerable: 8.1901.0-1

Recommendation:

Do not enable receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun).  Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.  The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does not enable any of these.</td>

<td>If you have configured a higher number of ports and VLANs (ports x VLANs) or the switch is a lower-powered (CPU) platform, the switchd service might fail to send a systemd keepalive within the watchdog timeout value (2 minutes by default) and you see an error similar to the following:

bq. systemd[1]: switchd.service watchdog timeout (limit 2min)!


To workaround this issue, either reduce the number of configured interfaces and/or VLANs or increase the systemd timeout for switchd.service.&lt;br/&gt;
To increase the systemd timeout:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Edit the /etc/systemd/system/switchd.service.d/override.conf file and increase the WatchdogSec parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Restart the switchd service with the sudo systemctl restart switchd.service command.&lt;br/&gt;
systemd will attempt to restart the switchd service automatically (after the watchdog timeout). If the restart fails multiple times in a short time period, run the sudo systemctl reset-failed command followed by the sudo systemctl restart switchd command.&lt;/li&gt;

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv&lt;/a&gt;). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. &lt;br/&gt;
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd


&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.&lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.&lt;/li&gt;

<td>On the Delta AG-6248C PoE switch, when you run the apt upgrade command, the upgrade does not work. Cumulus Linux uses uboot directly instead of grub to boot the kernel.

Without this header, when you use the apt upgrade command to upgrade Linux packages, uboot is unable to boot up the kernel. &lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the disk image. Run the onie-select command to go into ONIE, and then use the nos-install command in ONIE to install a new binary image.&lt;br/&gt;

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.&lt;br/&gt;

In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example:

 To work around this issue, run the following commands: 

 cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping 
 cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6


 Run the following command to verify the workaround: 
 
 
 cumulus@switch:~$ getcap /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping* 
 
 
 You should see the following output: 
 
 
 /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep 
 /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks.&lt;br/&gt;
For the 4.0.0 release, these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.76-1+cl4u1&lt;br/&gt;

<td>Received EVPN type-5 and type-2 MACIP routes are not installed in the kernel (and hardware) routing tables for the associated VRF, which causes traffic to be blackholed. The failure to install the default route causes complete reachability failure for the particular tenant on the affected racks. The routes that are not installed are seen as &quot;inactive&quot; in the routing subsystem (FRR) VRF routing table. This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.&lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the sudo systemctl restart frr.service command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:

ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123
