## Open issues in 4.0
|  Bug ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed in release	|
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| CM-28372 | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X switch, the default fan speed, which is defined in the thermal specification, results in excessive fan noise. | 3.7.11-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28313 | On the EdgeCore Wedge100 and Facebook Wedge-100S switch, certain physical ports are not correctly mapped to the logical ones. For example:<br />Logical swp39 controls physical swp41<br />Logical swp40 controls physical swp42<br />Logical swp43 controls physical swp45<br />Logical swp44 controls physical swp46<br />This might causes incorrect forwarding behavior. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28276 | When a Trident3 switch receives packets containing an IP checksum value that is not compliant with RFC 1624, the TTL is decremented after a routing operation but the checksum is not recalculated. This results in the IP checksum value being invalid as the packet leaves the switch.  | 3.7.10-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28226 | When you restart the hsflowd service, you see a systemd warning message similar to the following:<br /><br />Warning: The unit file, source configuration file or drop-ins of hsflowd@mgmt.service changed on disk. Run 'systemctl daemon-reload'.<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28200 | The Mellanox SN3700C switch encounters a memory leak after you apply an EVPN and PIM configuration. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28189 | When host-resources and ucd-snmp-mib are polled, you see permission denied messages similar to the following:<br /><br />Jan 30 19:22:53 switch123 snmpd[23172]: Cannot statfs /sys/kernel/debug/tracing: Permission denied<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28184 | TACACS users are unable to execute sudo commands.<br />To work around this issue, add the tacacs0 user to the sudo group; for example:<br /><br />cumulus@switch:~$  usermod -a -G sudo tacacs0<br /><br /><br />Alternatively, run the following command:<br /><br />ip vrf exec default sudo -i<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28169 | On the Dell Z9264F-ON switch, the CPU core temperature sensors report ABSENT. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28160 | On Broadcom Trident3 switches with DHCP relay, where the DHCP server is reachable through the EVPN overlay, DHCP discover packets forwarded to the CPU might appear corrupt and might not get forwarded. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28156 | NCLU crashes when you run the net add interface storage-optimized pfc command because non-ascii quotes exist in the datapath.conf file.<br />To work around this issue, manually edit the /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cumulus/__chip_config/mlx/datapath.conf file and replace the non-ascii single quotes  with ascii single quotes (standard single quote on the keyboard). | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28150 | On Broadcom switches with the Trident3 ASICs, the ECN-CE bit is set by default on transit traffic. This might result in hosts adjusting traffic behavior if they are configured for the ECN feature. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28136 | The MLAG switch pair has VLANs defined that are not used on MLAG bonds, these VLANs still synchronize MAC addresses across to the peer switch. This results in log messages that indicate a MAC address is installed and the VLAN is not defined; for example:<br /><br />RTM_NEWNEIGH with unconfigured vlan XXXX on port peerlink<br /><br /> | 3.7.10-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28119 | On the Delta AG6248C switch, the NCLU net show system sensors command shows an error:<br /><br />Could not collect output from command: ['/usr/sbin/smonctl']<br /><br /><br />To work around this issue, run the net show system sensors json command instead. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28087 | The last eight ports of the EdgeCore AS4610-54P switch (swp41 through swp48) do not power UPOE access points. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28086 | The ospfd daemon might crash with the following kernel trace: <br /><br />2019-11-06T23:00:08.261749+09:00 cumulus ospfd[5339]: Assertion `node' failed in file ospfd/ospf_packet.c, line 671, function ospf_write<br /><br /> | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28080 | TACACS+ through ClearPass is not currently supported. Cumulus Linux sends authorization before authentication, but ClearPass does not accept an authorization before the user is authenticated. | 3.7.11-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28077 | An unhandled exception might occur after you run the sudo poectl -i command. In addition, random poed daemon restarts can occur without any unhandled exceptions but with an invalid response length error. Both issues can occur due to a SerialException.<br />To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. A software reboot does not resolve the issue. | 3.7.10-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28076 | After you hot swap a PSU, the decode-syseeprom -t psuX command shows the old PSU information (such as the serial number), until you run the decode-syseeprom --init command. | 3.6.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28061 | On Trident3 switches, PFC is not working as expected. If you set the PFC for only one CoS,  pause frames are sent for all CoS traffic. | 3.7.11-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-28048 | The fan speeds on the Lenovo NE2580  switch are higher than expected within normal operating conditions. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28038 | After you convert a bond back to a layer 2 access port, ifupdown2 changes all SVI MTUs to 1500. <br />To work around this issue, run ifreload -a a second time. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-28016 | On Mellanox Spectrum switches, switchd can sometimes fail when PBR rules are installed or removed from hardware if the rule is setting a next hop learned via a routing protocol. | 3.7.7-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27957 | If you have configured a higher number of ports and VLANs (ports x VLANs) or the switch is a lower-powered (CPU) platform, the switchd service might fail to send a systemd keepalive within the watchdog timeout value (2 minutes by default) and you see an error similar to the following:<br /><br />bq. systemd[1]: switchd.service watchdog timeout (limit 2min)!<br /><br /><br />To workaround this issue, either reduce the number of configured interfaces and/or VLANs or increase the systemd timeout for switchd.service.<br />To increase the systemd timeout:<br /><br />	Edit the /etc/systemd/system/switchd.service.d/override.conf file and increase the WatchdogSec parameter.<br />	Restart the switchd service with the sudo systemctl restart switchd.service command.<br />systemd will attempt to restart the switchd service automatically (after the watchdog timeout). If the restart fails multiple times in a short time period, run the sudo systemctl reset-failed command followed by the sudo systemctl restart switchd command.<br /><br /> | 3.7.11-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-27950 | On the Dell S5232F, S5248F, S5296F, and S3048 switches, using the poweroff or halt commands does not fully power off the switch. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27947 | Broadcom Field Alert - SID - MMU 2B Errors<br />A few of the MMU memories on Broadcom switches are grouped together with single parity control. During SER correction when a parity error occurs on one of those groups, other memories in that group might also report a SER error. This occurs when the memory is accessed either by a packet hit or through a schan operation.This issue can cause SER errors in other memory and cause traffic mis-forwarding or a packet drop. | 3.7.0-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27855 | The FRR cl-support module times out on switches on the ARM platform even when the switch is not under heavy load.<br />To work around this issue, run the cl-support -M command to disable timeouts. | 3.7.0-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27801 | On the Mellanox SN3700C switch, if you try to break out 100G switch ports into 2x50G, the configuration fails and switchd does not restart. Breaking out the ports into 4x25G works without issue. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27793 | A security vulnerability has been announced in the cyrus-sasl2 (libsasl2-2 and libsasl2-modules) package. The libraries are installed by default on Cumulus Linux.<br />CVE-2019-19906: Stephan Zeisberg reported an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the _sasl_add_string() function in cyrus-sasl2, a library implementing the Simple Authentication and Security Layer. A remote attacker can take advantage of this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions for applications using the library.<br />Vulnerable: 2.1.27+dfsg-1<br />Fixed: 2.1.27+dfsg-1+deb10u1 | 3.0.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-27764 | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X, eth0 and swp1 use the same MAC address. | 3.7.9-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27753 | The EdgeCore Minipack-AS8000 supports FEC RS by default; you cannot disable this setting. However, the ethtool --show-fec command output indicates that FEC is disabled. Also, if you try to change the FEC setting, Cumulus Linux reports an error. For example:<br /><br />cumulus@switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link speed 100000<br />cumulus@switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link autoneg off<br />cumulus@switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link fec rs<br />"/sbin/ifreload -a" failed:<br />error: swp23: cmd '/sbin/ethtool --set-fec swp23 encoding rs' failed: returned 255 (Cannot set FEC settings: Operation not supported)<br />Command '['/sbin/ifreload', '-a']' returned non-zero exit status 1<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27740 | On a Mellanox SN3700C switch, when you run the NCLU net del all command to delete all configuration on the switch, you see an error similar to the following:<br /><br />ERROR: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/cumulus/switchd/config/interface/&lt;swp&gt;/port_security/enable'#012Traceback<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27719 | Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby language, which could result in unauthorized access by bypassing intended path matchings, denial of service, or the execution of arbitrary code.<br />These vulnerabilities affect the ruby2.5 package that is available for optional installation in Cumulus Linux 4.x, but is not installed by default.<br />CVE-2019-15845: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 mishandles path checking within File.fnmatch functions.<br />CVE-2019-16201: WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted network.<br />CVE-2019-16254: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.<br />CVE-2019-16255: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the "command" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.<br />Vulnerable: 2.5.5-3 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27699 | In a default VX instance, a ping to a device's hostname fails.<br />To work around this issue, edit the /etc/gai.conf file and uncomment precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27678 | The net show bridge macs command returns an empty interface column.<br />To work around this issue, run the bridge fdb show command to show the interface. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27670 | A memory leak in switchd might occur, which causes switchd to restart. | 3.7.10-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27645 | Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in git, a fast, scalable,<br />distributed revision control system, which is installed by default on Cumulus Linux 4.x.<br />CVE-2019-1348: export-marks is insecure, fix is to disable by default.<br />CVE-2019-1349: .git / git~1 filename vulnerability on NTFS<br />CVE-2019-1352: .git vulnerability with NTFS Alternate Streams Accesses<br />CVE-2019-1353: NTFS filesystem protection should be on by default<br />CVE-2019-1387: dubiously-nested submodule git directories should be disallowed<br />CVE-2019-19604: submodule update repository code execution vulnerability<br />Vulnerable: &lt;= 2.20.1-2<br />Fixed: 2.20.1-2+deb10u1 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27644 | Ifupdown2 does not set up the front panel interface for the dhclient to accept the DHCP OFFER.<br />To work around this issue, restart the networking service after ifreload -a with the systemctl restart networking command. | 3.7.10-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27642 | The following CVEs were announced that affect the libssh package:<br />CVE-2019-14889 has been announced in the libssh library, where unsanitized user-provided scp command lines could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.<br />The libssh library is not installed on Cumulus Linux by default, but is available in the Cumulus Linux 4 repository for optional installation. Note that libssh is distinct from libssh2 and openssh, which are present on the switches and in the repositories.<br />See the following for more information:<br />https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2019-14889.txt<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14889 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27637 | On the EdgeCore Minipack-AS8000 switch, a 100G DAC link does not come up when auto-negotiation is enabled on the neighbor. This switch does not support 100G DAC auto-negotiation at this time. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27619 | The following security vulnerabilities have been announced in the nss / libnss3 library, which is not installed by default but is available in the repository:<br />CVE-2019-11745: Out-of-bounds write when passing an output buffer smaller than the block size to NSC_EncryptUpdate<br />CVE-2019-17007: nss: Handling of Netscape Certificate Sequences in CERT_DecodeCertPackage() may crash with a NULL deref leading to DoS<br />See https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/nss for more information.<br />Vulnerable: &lt;= 3.42.1-1+deb10u1 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27496 | All Broadcom Trident3 X7 switches contain PCIE firmware, which is programmed by the vendor when the switch is manufactured. The latest version of this firmware (2.6) is incompatible with Cumulus Linux 3.7.11 and earlier, and Cumulus Linux 4.0. <br />To work around this issue, downgrade the Broadcom ASIC firmware to an earlier version.<br />A fix for this issue will be provided in a future Cumulus Linux release. | 3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27457 | If you delete, then re-add a PBR policy on an interface, the configured PBR policy is not programmed in the kernel or switchd. | 3.7.9-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27456 | After making a series of PBR configuration changes using NCLU commands, the stale PBR entry is still present in the kernel. | 3.7.9-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27444 | If you use the NCLU commands to configure NTP and run the net add time ntp source &lt;interface&gt; command before you run the net add time ntp server &lt;server&gt; iburst command, the /etc/ntp.conf file is misconfigured.<br />To work around this issue, run the net add time ntp server &lt;server&gt; iburst command before you run the net add time ntp source &lt;interface&gt; command. | 3.7.10-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27367 | Under certain circumstances, switchd might crash, then restart, on Mellanox switches with the Spectrum or Spectrum-2 ASIC.   | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27299 | The protocol daemon bgpd crashes when a link/neighbor flaps if static routes pointing to Null0 are advertising through BGP.<br />To work around this issue, reboot the switch, then remove the static routes or stop advertising these routes. | 3.7.9-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27295 | IPv6 table rules might affect forwarding. For example, if you create the following rule in the /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/03-sshd.rules file, the rule counter increments but IPv4 SSH traffic might be dropped.<br /><br />[ip6tables]<br />-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP<br /><br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27275 | CVE-2018-12207: Improper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating system for multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service of the host system via local access.<br />Running hypervisors for virtual guest operating systems is not supported on Cumulus Linux.  Additionally, an affected package qemu is not included in the image, although it is available on upstream repo mirrors.   | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27254 | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum and Spectrum-2 ASIC, IPv6 egress ACLs are not supported on subinterfaces. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27243 | The length of the netlink message is not set properly for non-bridge family type messages. The same length is used for both bridge and non-bridge family type messages even though the bridge family type message has an extra attribute. This causes extra bytes to be left over in non-bridge family type netlink messages. | 3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27229 | On a traditional bridge, VLAN tagged traffic is not discarded when it exceeds the port security MAC limit. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27193 | The l1-show command prints a traceback for switch ports that have sub-interfaces configured. There is no functional impact to traffic but the l1-show troubleshooting and validation command does not execute on switch ports that have VLAN sub-interfaces. | 3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27184 | With the port security feature, if you change the number of MAC addresses allowed to access a port with the NCLU net add interface &lt;port&gt; port-security mac-limit &lt;number&gt; command, the net show configuration commands command might fail. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27173 | On Trident3 switches, unicast ARP packets received on a VNI and forwarded to the CPU are not policed. | 3.7.10-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-27143 | The CPU core temperature sensors are absent on the Dell S5248F-ON switch. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27136 | With a high number of active routes (20K or more), when you perform a networking restart, the FRR log files might become flooded with error messages associated with the restart. These logs are normal and are not directly a problem. However, the large number of messages can cause the logs to rotate away any previous history, which prevents you from tracing back events leading up to the restart. In a troubleshooting environment, this can be problematic. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27131 | On switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, SPAN and ERSPAN functionality is not supported. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27118 | Switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, might not learn all MAC address on a port configured for bridging when the hardware MAC table is near the maximum capacity. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27099 | Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is not currently supported on Mellanox switches with the Spectrum-2 ASIC.  | 4.0.0 | |

| CM-27081 | On the switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, if you configure more than 96 ports in a layer 2 bridge, switchd might hit a timeout error and restart.   | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-27018 | When more than one VRR interface is configured on an SVI interface, deleting one of the VRR addresses does not remove the interface/address.  | 3.7.10-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26996 | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum ASIC, the --set-burst parameter in an iptables rule does not take effect. | 3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26968 | When networking fails to start properly, an MLAG memory leak occurs, which might cause memory issues. | 3.7.9-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26961 | On Mellanox switches, error messages with hw-management-thermal-events.sh are displayed on shutdown. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-26942 | Port security is not currently supported on VX. The NCLU commands produce errors. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-26921 | If you delete an undefined bond, then add a bond slave, the net commit command fails. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26913 | FRR configuration commands for an SVI interface might have the \n misplaced in the output.  For example:<br /><br />sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50\nvrf TEST description L3 routing interface\n' &gt;&gt; /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /><br /><br />should be:<br /><br />sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50 vrf TEST\ndescription L3 routing interface\n' &gt;&gt; /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /><br /><br />To work around this issue, configure the interface manually in the /etc/frr/frr.conf file. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26907 | NCLU incorrectly allows you to apply port security configuration on layer 2 and layer 3 ports that are not part of a bridge. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-26905 | When you update the hostname of a switch with the NCLU net add hostname &lt;hostname&gt; command, then run net commit, the lldpd service is not restarted and other devices still see the old name.<br />To work around this issue, run the sudo systemctl restart lldpd.service command. | 3.7.10-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26875 | After deleting an IPv6 numbered BGP peer group neighbor, Cumulus Linux may continue to send RAs.  To address this, restart frr after removing IPv6 numbered configuration. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26860 | When you run the NCLU net show commit last command, there is no output. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-26839 | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, CPU core temp sensors may show as ABSENT. | 4.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-26838 | You might experience a bgpd memory usage increase and significant update exchanges due to host moves between VTEPs. | 3.7.7-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26769 | Setting ProtoDown on ports populated with SFP modules providing RJ-45 1000BASE-T interfaces does not cause the carrier to be dropped. The kernel shows carrier down; however, the remote device still shows a link. | 3.7.6-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26702 | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum-2 ASIC, policy-based routing (PBR) is not currently supported. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-26655 | Reconfiguring an NTP server via NCLU with different trailing options (such as iburst) after the IP address causes an invalid configuration to be added to the /etc/ntp.conf file.  As an example<br /><br />net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4 iburst<br />net commit<br />net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4<br />net commit<br /><br /><br />If you need to alter existing server configurations, first remove the server, commit, then re-add the server with any trailing options. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26599 | Auto-negotiation does not work with the QSFP28 cables and a remote system opreating at 10G. Attempting to enable auto-negotiation via ethtool -s swp&lt;#&gt; autoneg on returns Operation not supported.<br /><br />As a workaround, do not use auto-negotiation and set the local port speed to 10G. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26595 | The NCLU net show lldp command displays the speed of a ganged port group as the speed of one of the individual links, rather than the sum of their speeds. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26525 | When an MLAG peerlink frequently alternates states between learning and blocking, an excessive number of TCP sessions might be created, which results in the following error display:<br /><br />OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files<br /><br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26516 | Applying a policy-based routing (PBR) rule for all traffic from a host might disrupt ARP refresh for that connected host. | 3.7.5-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26450 | Cumulus Linux poed generates excessive debug log entries.  These will be reduced in a future release. | 3.7.3-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26423 | NCLU requires you to specify an interface with multiple address-virtual statements in ascending MAC address order. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26412 | Mac learning is not disabled by default on a double tagged peer link interface resulting in the MAC address flipping between the MLAG bond and the peer link.<br />To work around this issue, disable MAC learning on QinQ VLANs by adding bridge-learning off to the VLAN stanza in the etc/network/interfaces file. | 3.7.9-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26308 | An interface alias configured outside FRR using iproute2 is imported into the FRR running configuration and overrides the internal description. After an FRR reload, this causes FRR to delete the interface alias in an inefficient way. Depending on how many interfaces with aliases you have configured, this can cause a FRR reload to time out.<br />To work around this issue, remove the interface alias description from iproute2. | 3.7.8-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|

| CM-26158 | On Mellanox switches, UFT profiles are unable to support the documented capacity for routes to addresses that are more than 64 bits in length. The listed capacities assume 64-bit destination IP addresses. | 3.7.8-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26139 | Selective ERSPAN does not work when you specify a bridge port. | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26138 | You cannot specify a source and destination MAC address in an ERSPAN ebtables rule. For example, the following rule does not work:<br /><br />-A FORWARD -i swp5 -s 00:25:90:b2:bd:9d -d 50:6b:4b:96:c4:04 -j erspan --src-ip 100.1.1.2 --dst-ip 100.1.1.1 --ttl 64<br /><br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26137 | ERSPAN in ebtables does not work for VNIs. For example, the following rule does not work:<br /><br />-A FORWARD -i vni10 -j erspan --src-ip 100.1.1.2 --dst-ip 100.1.1.1 --ttl 64<br /><br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26136 | In an ebtables rule, ERSPAN (upper case) does not work. You need to specify erspan (lower case). | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-26024 | On switches with the Spectrum ASIC, the underlay hashes VXLAN packets for a given overlay flow randomly.<br />To work around this issue, configure the ECMP hash seed to the same value on the EVPN egress leaf switches. | 3.7.7-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25986 | On the Mellanox SN3700C switch, the time required to establish a link (from the time a link is set to admin up until the link becomes operationally up) can take between 5 and 10 seconds. <br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-25890 | In some cases, the switchd service might warn of excessive MAC moves from one switch port to itself (for example, from swp18 to swp18). | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25859 | The MTU of an SVI cannot be higher than the MTU on the bridge. Changing the MTU on the SVI with NCLU does not update the bridge MTU. The net commit commands succeeds even though the MTU is not changed as expected.<br />To work around this issue, change the MTU on all SVIs and the bridge manually in the /etc/network/interfaces file, then apply the change with the ifreload -a command. | 3.7.7-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25815 | When an SVI with a virtual MAC is configured with a layer 2 VNI in an EVPN environment , if the /etc/network/interfaces file is replaced with a different file that does not have the SVI and layer 2 VNI configuration anymore, the original virtual MAC does not get populated through the EVPN route until FRR is restarted. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25766 | When you run the apt upgrade command on the Dell-N3048EP switch, the upgrade does not work. <br /> | 3.7.7-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25740 | On Broadcom Maverick switches with a QinQ configuration, the packets coming into the CPU might be tagged incorrectly; for example, 802.1ad + 802.1q tags are expected in the packets but the packets have 802.1q + 802.1q tags. <br /> To work around this issue, configure the bridge with bridge-vlan-protocol 802.1ad: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge mybridge vlan-protocol 802.1ad <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25694 | If a packet is policed by ebtables, it does not increment an ACL drop on the ingress interface. Instead, it increments the TDBGC3/6 drop counter to the CPU. | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25693 | After you issue the NCLU net del bgp vrf &lt;vrf&gt; autonomous-system &lt;AS&gt; command and commit the change, Cumulus Linux does not remove the configuration from the /etc/frr/frr.conf file or the net show config commands. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-25665 | On Broadcom Trident 3 switches, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:<br /><br />	VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.<br />	VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack.<br /><br /><br /><br />To work around this issue, either:<br /><br />	Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)<br />	Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)<br /><br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-25641 | If the BMC operating system fails to respond to IPMI, you see a traceback in bmcd, and all the sensors might report ABSENT devices in smonctl. <br /> To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25505 | During the bring-up sequence following a reboot, VXLAN routed packets (tenant traffic flows) transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the clagd init-delay timer expires. <br />The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd. To route the tenant traffic flows, the kernel must perform address resolution but has to wait for the clagd init-delay timer to expire before the bonds can forward traffic. During the time when the ARP entry is unresolved, packets might be dropped. <br />During the init-delay period, the ARP cache is not yet populated so the problem exists until either the init-delay timer expires or clagd neighbor synchronization is complete. By default the clagd init-delay timer is set to 10 seconds and clagd neighbor synchronization occurs halfway through the init-delay period. Traffic resumes forwarding after one of the two criteria described above are met. <br />You might see this issue in EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link. <br />To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br />In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: <br /><br /> <br />ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ <br /><br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 <br />match as-path MY_ASN <br />set as-path prepend 4200000101 <br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20 <br /><br />  | 3.7.6-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-25400 | If an SVI exists in the configuration before you assign it an IP address, when you do assign the IP address with the NCLU command, the vlan-id and the raw-device bridge stanzas are not added automatically. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-25397 | When first creating a bond and enslaving an interface, NCLU hides some of the bridge command suggestions, although they are still accepted. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24993 | When you try to change the NTP time zone with the NCLU net add time zone &lt;timezone&gt; command or by editing the /etc/timezone file manually, the configuration does not take effect.<br />To work around this issue, change the time zone with the sudo timedatectl set-timezone &lt;timezone&gt; command. For example:<br /><br />cumulus@switch:~$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone US/Eastern<br /><br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-24894 | The maximum-prefix configuration under the IPv4 address family has an optional restart value which you can configure. This configuration is ignored and, instead of restarting the sessions every x minutes, the peer constantly changes between established and idle due to the prefix count being exceeded. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24803 | When you execute the following command on the Dell N3048EP-ON or the Delta AG6248C, the switch reboots and then comes right back into Cumulus Linux without installing the new image. The install image is still in /var/lib/cumulus/installer, which causes issues with cl-support. <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -fai http://&lt;path to image&gt; <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo reboot <br /> <br /> <br />To work around this issue, use the onie-select command to access ONIE, and then use the nos-install command in ONIE to install a new binary image. <br />The workaround only works when an out-of-band network is present. | 3.7.6-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24799 | On switches using the Trident2 ASIC, 802.1Q-encapsulated control plane traffic received on an interface with 802.1AD configured subinterfaces might be dropped. <br />This issue only affects QinQ configurations. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24762 | On the EdgeCore AS7326 switch, the 1000BASE-T SFP RJ-45 on a 25G port does not work at 1G. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-24751 | On the QuantaMesh T4048-IX8 or EdgeCore AS7326-56X switches, when using a 1000BASE-T SFP module, the module LEDs do not light to reflect link status.<br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24652 | In an EVPN environment, the centralized MAC address is not getting installed on the MLAG pair because Cumulus Linux does not perform an SVI MAC check per VLAN. <br /> This issue does not manifest itself in a pure distributed routing (symmetric or asymmetric) environment or in a pure centralized routing environment. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24618 | If the interface alias contains a single or double quotation mark, or an apostrophe, the net show configuration commands fail with the following error: <br /> <br /> <br /> ERROR: No closing quotation <br /> See /var/log/netd.log for more details. <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.6.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24473 | SNMP incorrectly requires engine ID specification. <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24435 | When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a match interface condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. <br /> For example, this command is incorrect: <br /> <br /> <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 <br /> <br /> <br /> These commands are correct: <br /> <br /> <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9 <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 30 match interface swp10 <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24426 | NCLU allows for the configuration of addresses on VRF interfaces, but tab completion for the net add vrf &lt;name&gt; command just displays &lt;ENTER&gt;. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ net add vrf mgmt <br /> &lt;ENTER&gt; <br /> <br /> <br /> Tab completion for the net add vrf &lt;name&gt; ip address &lt;address&gt; command works correctly. <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24379 | On Maverick switches, CPU forwarded packets might be dropped when there is no route to a leaked host route. | 3.7.5-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24343 | The net del bridge bridge mcsnoop yes command does not return the value to the default of disabled. <br />To work around this issue, use the net add bridge bridge mcsnoop no command to delete the mcsnoop attribute and return to the default value. | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24332 | On Broadcom switches, when moving configuration from bridged to routed (or toggling from routed to bridged to routed), some traffic is not seen by the kernel. This can cause BGP to not establish on a transit node. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24272 | When you try to configure the VRRP priority and advertisement-interval with NCLU on a traditional mode bridge, the net commit command fails. <br /> To work around this issue, use the vtysh command (inside FRR) to change the VRRP priority or advertisement-interval on traditional bridges. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface br0.100 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 priority 110 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 advertisement-interval <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus@switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24271 | On SVIs in a VLAN-aware bridge, you cannot change the VRRP priority with NCLU. <br /> To work around this issue, run the vtysh command inside FRR to change the default priority. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface vlan100 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 priority 110 <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus@switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24270 | Cumulus Linux uses VRRPv3 as the default version, and enables both preempt and accept mode by default. You cannot change these default values with NCLU. <br />To work around this issue, run the vtysh commands (inside FRR) to change the default values. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface swp4 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 version 2 <br /> switch(config-if)# no vrrp 1 preempt <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus@switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24262 | NCLU does not honor "auto all" in the /etc/network/interfaces file and removes the existing configuration if no individual auto &lt;iface&gt; lines exist. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24241 | When you try to remove a BGP peer group configuration with NCLU, the command fails but no warning message is shown. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ net del bgp neighbor fabric peer-group <br /> 'router bgp 65001' configuration does not have 'neighbor fabric peer-group' <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24222 | When an LDAP user that does not have NCLU privileges (either in the netshow or netedit group, or in the /etc/netd.conf file) runs an NCLU command, a traceback occurs instead of a permissions error. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-24035 | On the Edgecore 4610-54P switch, automatic medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) stops working on a 100M full duplex interface and does not detect the required cable connection type. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23825 | The net add interface &lt;interface&gt; ptm-enable command adds no ptm-enable for that interface in the frr.conf file. <br /> Running the net add or the net del command does not remove no ptm-enable from the frr.conf file. You have to remove it manually using vtysh. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23665 | NCLU automatically adds the VLAN ID (for the layer 3 VNI/SVI) to the bridge when using net add vxlan &#91;L3VNI&#93; bridge access &#91;VLAN&#93; <br />This configuration breaks network connectivity in an MLAG system in an EVPN symmetric routing configuration. <br />To restore connectivity, you need to remove the VLAN ID from the bridge. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23661 | When you configure a GRE tunnel on a Mellanox switch, the traffic behind the local tunnel endpoint destined through the GRE tunnel is software-forwarded. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23651 | In an EVPN symmetric routing configuration, when an IP address is frozen, kernel neighbor table information and kernel VRF routing table information about the frozen IP address might be out-of-sync. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23584 | When you configure a control plane ACL to define permit and deny rules destined to the local switch, NCLU programs the control plane ACL rules into the FORWARD chain. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23570 | On an RMP/1G-T switch, when you remove link-speed 100 with the NCLU command or by editing the etc/network/interfaces file to revert the 100M interface to the default (1G auto), the interface fails to recover and does not come back up.<br />After you remove the link-speed, ethtool shows the advertised link modes as not reported and Speed/Duplex as unknown.<br />To work around this issue and bring the interface back up, either restart switchd or use ethtool to configure the speed, advertised, duplex or MDI-X settings. <br />Note: The advertised link mode gets set incorrectly if you include 1000baseT/Half. The port will come up successfully at 1G. | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23418 | For QSFP modules, the sudo ifdown command does not disable the Tx laser. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23417 | When using NCLU to create an ibgp peering across the peerlink, the addition of the net add bgp l2vpn evpn neighbor peerlink.4094 activate command creates a new EBGP neighborship when one has already been configured for IBGP. This is unexpected, the existing IBGP configuration is valid. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23397 | On Broadcom switches, when a link-local multicast frame is received on an access port with a VNI in the bridge, two copies of the packet are sent across the VNI to remote VTEPs and the receiving hosts observe duplicate packets. <br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23311 | In an EVPN centralized routing configuration, where the layer 2 network extends beyond VTEPs, (for example, host with bridges), the gateway MAC address does not get refreshed in the network when ARP suppression is enabled on the gateway.<br />To work around this issue, disable ARP suppression on the centralized gateway. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-23075 | There is a limitation on the number of SVI interfaces you can specify as DHCP relay interfaces in the /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay file. For example, 1500 SVI interfaces causes the dhcrelay service to exit without a core file and logs similar to the following are generated for the interfaces: <br /> <br /> <br /> 2018-11-10T23:35:30.992370-08:00 Dev dhcrelay: Listening on LPF/vlan.101/a0:00:00:00:00:51 <br /> 2018-11-10T23:35:30.993472-08:00 Dev dhcrelay: Sending on LPF/vlan.101/a0:00:00:00:00:51 <br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually the dhcrelay service stops. <br /> | 3.7.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-23021 | When you run the mstpctl command, you might see the bridge-port state as blocking when it is actually disabled. You might see the same incorrect bridge-port state when other programs or tools use the output of mstpctl; for example, SNMP output from the BRIDGE-MIB. | 3.7.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22794 | The Dell S5048F-ON switch (with reverse airflow, rear to front), shows the Temp-3 sensor as absent. <br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22591 | CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br />To work around this issue, create a file called /etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf and add these settings:<br /><br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144<br /><br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.114.0.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-22554 | If you try to bring down several members of a bond remotely at the same time, the link state of one of the interfaces might not transition correctly to the down state; however, all links show down in hardware. <br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22386 | The BFD packet redirection logic used by OVSDB server high availability mode redirects BUM packets across the peerlink. The iptables rule for redirection does differentiate between BFD and non-BFD VXLAN inner packets because the service node sends all frames with its own IP address as the tunnel source IP address. The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22301 | For an unresolved address, the IPROUTER default policer rule has been modified to not match on packets exiting a TUNNEL and headed to the CPU to resolve the address via ARP. As a result, the following default rule no longer matches TUNNEL ingress packets. <br /> <br /> <br /> A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -m addrtype --dst-type <br /> IPROUTER -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 400 --set-burst 100 <br /> <br /> <br /> These packets are now policed by catch all rules. <br /> To work around this issue, the VPORT value on a TRIDENT switch must be changed from binary 011 to 100. <br /> | 3.6.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22287 | When a layer 3 ECMP path is brought down on the EdgeCore AS7712 (Tomahawk) switch running in atomic mode, traffic traversing the path stops working for about four seconds. When the switch is changed to non-atomic mode, the delay is less than one second. This issue is seen across OSPF and static ECMP routes.  | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22228 | Counters associated with VLANs and VRFs are not working on Trident 2+ switches. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22041 | At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues. This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in No buffer space available error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a switchd restart. | 3.4.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-22020 | On the Trident3 platform, static PIM with IIF based on a layer 2 bridge does not work reliably. PIM Join via signaling is required for IPMC to work properly.<br />To work around this issue, use dynamic signaling (joins) to manage IP multicast traffic. | 3.7.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21927 | When running ifreload after updating an interface configuration, sometimes VLANs are not programmed into the hardware data plane. The Linux control plane looks normal but the VLAN has not been programmed into the hardware and packets that arrive for the VLAN might be dropped. <br />To work around this issue, remove and re-add the affected VLANs from the port. <br /> | 3.5.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21898 | On a Trident 3 switch, IGMP packets are not getting policed by the police rule in the 00control ACL file. The packets are policed by the catchall policer in the 99control ACL file instead. <br /> -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100 <br /> To work around this issue, let the CPU bound IGMP packet hit the following rule and change the policer rate to a desired value for IGMP packets: <br /> -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100 <br /> Typically, the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx is used only for PIM/IGMP control and data stream packets. However, this workaround cannot handle data stream multicast packets that are not TCP/UDP; this is not typically done. <br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21785 | The source address of the ICMPv6 time exceeded message (traceroute hop) is sourced from the wrong VRF when the traceroute target resides on the same switch but in a different VRF. | 3.6.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21769 | On a Mellanox switch, GRE tunneling does not work if the tunnel source is configured on an SVI interface. If  the tunnel source is configured on a physical switch port, then tunneling works as expected. | 3.6.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21678 | On a Dell switch with a Maverick ASIC, NetQ might receive false alerts like the following via PagerDuty: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ netq show sensors temp changes \| grep absent \| grep -v psu <br /> P2Leaf01 temp9 networking asic die temp sensor absent 43 105 100 5 Unable to find driver path: /cumulu Add 7d:22h:1m:41s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 45 105 100 5 Unable to find driver path: /cumulu Add 7d:22h:1m:41s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 47 105 100 5 Unable to read temp4_highest Add 9d:23h:26m:6s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 45 105 100 5 Unable to read temp4_highest Add 14d:22h:46m:45s <br /> <br /> <br /> This message might occur as a result of a timeout at the hardware level, or the switch might be reporting a failure to get a response. <br /> | 3.5.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21667 | FRR does not add BGP ttl-security to either the running configuration or to the /etc/frr/frr.conf file when configured on a peer group instead of a specific neighbor. <br />To work around this issue, add ttl-security to individual neighbors instead of the peer group. | 3.6.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-21278 | The net show lldp command sometimes shows the port description in the Remote Port field. The net show interface command shows the correct value in the Remote Host field.<br />To work around this issue, use net show interface command for LLDP output when connected to Cisco equipment. | 3.5.3-3.7.104.0.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-21055 | On Mellanox switches, the destination MAC address of ERSPAN GRE packets is set to all zeros; therefore, the packets might be dropped by the first transit switch. | 3.6.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-20813 | Span rules matching the out-interface as a bond do not mirror packets. | 3.6.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-20508 | The Cumulus-Resource-Query-MIB defines the ability to gather buffer utilization status but when these objects are polled, they return nothing.  | 3.5.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-20033 | The VLAN interface stays up even though the physical link carrying the VLAN is admin or carrier down.<br /> | 3.5.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-19788 | If you configure a VLAN under a VLAN-aware bridge and create a subinterface of the same VLAN on one of the bridge ports, the bridge and interface compete for the same VLAN and if the interface is flapped, it stops working. Correcting the configuration and running the ifreload command does not resolve the conflict. <br />To work around this issue, correct the bridge VIDs and restart switchd or delete the subinterface.  | 3.5.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-19724 | PIM and MSDP entries are set to the internal COS value of 6 so they are grouped together with the bulk traffic priority group in the default traffic.conf file. However, PIM, IGMP, and MSDP are considered control-plane and should be set to the internal COS value of 7.  | 3.5.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-19454 | When you use NCLU to bring a bond admin down (net add bond &lt;bond&gt; link down), the bond interface goes into admin down state but the switch ports enslaved to the bond remain UP. If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br />To work around this issue, use the sudo ifdown &lt;bondname&gt; command. | 3.5.0-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-17494 | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br />To work around this issue, change the value of arp_ignore to 2. See Default ARP Settings in Cumulus Linux for more information. | 3.3.2-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-16571 | NCLU cannot manage rsyslog to addresses routed via a VRF.  In Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and later, management VRF is enabled by default.   To work around this issue, update the /etc/network/interfaces file to disable management VRF. | 3.4.3-3.7.124.0.0 | |
| CM-15812 | Multicast forwarding fails for IP addresses whose DMAC overlaps with reserved DIPs. | 3.2.1-3.7.124.0.0 | |

GPUs are not present on our switches.<br />CVE-2019-11135, CVE-2019-11139: Intel CPU transactional memory vulnerability.  None of our switches support transactional memory.<br />For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at:<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux |  | |
| CM-26815 | If a router MAC address changes on a VTEP, other VTEPs might still point to the previous router MAC address. | 3.7.10 | |
| CM-26691 | BGP is configured with soft reconfiguration-in for its peers, which is not working correctly and causes routes to have an unexpected label. As a result, transit traffic is not forwarded by the switch. | 3.7.8-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26657 | When you install a large number of new rules with nonatomic mode enabled, there is a chance that you install more rules than the number of available slots in the slice, which results in the slice being completely wiped and reinstalled. This causes a large drop increase, including to cpu0, and might cause a major outage by dropping all BGP sessions. | 3.6.1-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26523 | Package: hostapd<br />CVE ID: CVE-2019-13377 CVE-2019-16275<br />Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).<br />CVE-2019-13377<br />A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.<br />CVE-2019-16275<br />Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.<br />Fixed version: 1:2.8.0-cl4u3 | 3.7.0-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26272 | On the Mellanox Spectrum switch, a route withdrawal might cause the associated next hop neighbor entry to be deleted in hardware but remain in the kernel. This can cause traffic going through the directly connected route to the removed neighbor entry to be forwarded to the CPU. | 3.7.6-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26230 | When local-tunnelip is an SVI, the static VXLAN tunnel does not work; the next hop router receives the packet but drops it as it does not know where to forward the packet. The static VXLAN tunnel does works if local-tunnelip is a loopback or a physical layer 3 interface. <br /> | 3.7.8-3.7.12 | |
| CM-26181 | ACL rules, such as the following, fail to install if you use swp+ (interfaces mentioned as wildcards).<br /><br />-A FORWARD -i swp+ -j LOG<br />-A FORWARD -i swp+ -j DROP<br /><br /><br />You can now install such rules with swp+. | 3.7.3-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26169 | Cumulus Linux does not map QinQ packets to VXLANs in a configuration with a VLAN-aware bridge and MLAG on the Trident3 platform. <br /> | 3.7.9-3.7.10 | |
| CM-26147 | On the EdgeCore AS4610 switch, the ping command fails unless you run the command with sudo. <br /> To work around this issue, run the following commands: <br /><br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6<br /><br /><br /> Run the following command to verify the workaround: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus@switch:~$ getcap /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping* <br /> <br /> <br /> You should see the following output: <br /> <br /> <br /> /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep <br /> /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.10 | |

| CM-26126 | Tomahawk 40G DACs cannot disable auto-negotiation. | 3.7.7-3.7.12 | |
| CM-25973 | After a remote VTEP peer link goes down, the tunnel destination IP address might be incorrect in hardware, which might cause loss of overlay communication between VTEPs. | 3.7.8-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25955 | Lenovo switches do not send or receive LLDP on eth0 interfaces. | 3.7.7-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25824 | NCLU restarts FRR when attempting to remove a BGP VRF stanza. This happens regardless of whether the VRF is valid/configured elsewhere on the switch or the removal is successful. <br />To work around this issue, remove the stanza using vtysh. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25796 | Received EVPN type-5 and type-2 MACIP routes are not installed in the kernel (and hardware) routing tables for the associated VRF, which causes traffic to be blackholed. The failure to install the default route causes complete reachability failure for the particular tenant on the affected racks. The routes that are not installed are seen as "inactive" in the routing subsystem (FRR) VRF routing table. This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.<br />To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the sudo systemctl restart frr.service command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:<br /><br />ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123<br /><br /><br />You can run the net show vrf vni command to print a mapping of VRF : L3-VNI : L3-SVI. | 3.7.5-3.7.12 | |
| CM-25794 | Under certain conditions, EVPN next hops might not be removed when the contributing peer goes down or might not be populated when the BGP session to the contributing peer comes up.<br />You can prevent EVPN next hops from not being removed when the contributing peer goes down by specifying static MAC addresses on all layer 3 VNIs. There is no workaround for preventing EVPN next hops from not being populated when the BGP session to the contributing peer comes up. | 3.7.2-3.7.12 | |
| CM-25747 | When transitioning from a down state to an up state due to peerlink failure and recovery, MLAG does not start the initDelay timer before trying to bring everything back up. | 3.7.7-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25718 | IF-MIB::ifHCInOctets reports significantly lower values than reported by interface counters seen elsewhere. | 3.7.6-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25672 | snmpd fails because NCLU does not remove agentaddress @vrf lines when running the net add snmp-server listening-address all command. | 3.7.4-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25447 | When you define a trap destination using @mgmt, snmpd indicates that the network is unreachable even though the IP address is reachable in the management VRF. <br /> To work around this issue, remove @mgmt vrf references in the /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file, stop snmpd, then start snmpd manually in the management VRF with the systemctl start snmpd@mgmt command. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.10 | |
| CM-25376 | When you generate a cl-support file, clagd.service prints log messages similar to the following: <br /> <br /> <br /> 019-03-21T07:18:15.727581+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: DumpThreadStacks - start <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.728157+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: #012thread: CollectSysInfo (140608446367488) <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.735986+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py, line 783, in __bootstrap <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.736585+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py, line 810, in __bootstrap_inner <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.737045+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py, line 763, in run <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.737933+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/sbin/clagd, line 930, in CollectSysInfoT <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.739527+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/sbin/clagd, line 187, in CollectSysInfo <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.740540+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py, line 621, in wait <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:15.742293+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: file: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/clag/clagthread.py, line 48, in wait <br /> . <br /> . <br /> 2019-03-21T07:18:16.456061+00:00 leaf01 clagd[20912]: DumpThreadStacks - end <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.10 | |
| CM-24686 | On the EdgeCore AS5812-54X switch, the PSU2 Fan1 fluctuates between OK and LOW. When the fan speed is reported as LOW, the RPM is shown as a negative number. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12 | |
| CM-23792 | When you delete post-up and pre-down IP peer entries from the etc/network/interfaces file, then run the ifreload command, the IP addresses are not removed and the route remains in the route table. <br /> To work around this issue, either delete the IP addresses without the /32 mask component or flush the IP addresses for the interface with the ip addr flush dev &lt;interface&gt; command. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12 | |
| CM-23440 | In an EVPN symmetric routing deployment with active-active anycast IP configured, the next hop attribute is sometimes set to a unique address instead of the anycast IP address. <br /> To work around this issue, do not use default-originate ipv4; instead configure the network statements (recommended for small scale deployments). <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12 | |
| CM-23016 | When FRR restarts, snmp&#91;err&#93; dev/kmem: Permission denied error messages are recorded in the log file and SNMPd might crash periodically. | 3.7.5-3.7.10 | |
| CM-22808 | When you try to stop hsflowd on the Trident II+ switch with the systemctl stop hsflowd command, the process hangs until you stop it with SIGKILL. <br /> | 3.5.2-3.7.12 | |
| CM-22605 | On a Dell S4048 switch, when you set the eth0 speed to 100, either with NCLU or by editing the /etc/network/interfaces file, the igb driver crashes, which brings down eth0. <br />To work around this issue: <br /><br />	If eth0 is configured in the management VRF, power cycle the switch; the eth0 configuration fails and reverts back to the default (auto-negotiation/1000).<br />	If eth0 is configured in the default VRF and you power cycle after the crash, igb continues to crash on boot up (before getting to login prompt); power-cycle the switch, select the Advanced option in GRUB to boot to recovery mode, then modify the /etc/network/interfaces file.<br /><br /> | 3.5.3-3.7.10 | |
| CM-21058 | The advertised routes list may be empty for an EVPN peering even though the remote switch reports received routes. | 3.6.0-3.7.12 | |
| CM-20534 | The default BGP instance must be provisioned and always exist for proper operation of dynamic leaking of routes between VRFs.  | 3.7.0-3.7.10 | |
| CM-20132 | On Trident2 switches running 802.3x regular link pause, pause frames are accounted in HwIfInDiscards counters and are dropped instead of processed. | 3.5.2-3.7.10 | |
| CM-17557 | When sFlow is enabled, some sampled packets, such as IPMC, are forwarded twice (in the ASIC and then again through the kernel networking stack). | 3.4.0-3.7.12 | |
| CM-15601 | On a Mellanox switch in an MLAG environment, a packet from a dually connected host might ingress on one switch but the MAC DA is destined to the router on the peer switch. The packet will traverse the peer link but is not excluded from port isolation (or egress mask) filtering. Similarly, an IP multicast packet might traverse the peer link and need to be routed. | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |
| CM-15094 | Counter samples for an 80G bond (2 x 40G) exported from the switch show an interface speed (ifSpeed) of 14.464Gbps. <br /> | 3.2.0-3.7.12 | |
