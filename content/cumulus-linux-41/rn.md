|  Bug ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed in release	|
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| CM-28866 | 100G links to the Mellanox SN3800 switch do not come up unless the neighbor is configured for RS FEC. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28830 | hsflowd does not work with the management VRF. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28821 | When configuring VRF route leaking, if you define import vrf route-map &lt;name&gt; but do not have any imported VRFs, the route map command displays incorrectly, as result FRR fails to reload. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28816 | The following security advisory has been announced for bash: <br />CVE-2019-18276 Qualys scan QID 372268 setuid vulnerability<br />When bash or bash scripts are run setuid, bash is supposed to drop privileges, but does so incorrectly, so that an attacker with command access to the shell can use enable -f for runtime loading of a new builtin that calls setuid() to regain dropped privileges.<br />To work around this issue, do not make bash or bash scripts setuid. | 3.0.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28794 | When the NETQ agent is active, you see the following errors in in the FFR log file: <br />2020-03-05T16:00:05.036398+09:00 [switch01][bgpd][err] [EC 100663314] Attempting to process an I/O event but for fd: 29(4) no thread to handle this!<br />2020-03-05T16:01:30.841455+09:00 [switch01[bgpd][err] [EC 100663314] Attempting to process an I/O event but for fd: 29(4) no thread to handle this!<br /><br />You also see the following errors in the ptmd log file:<br />2020-03-05T15:59:12.877549+09:00 [switch01][ptmd][info] New client connection fd[17] tot[1]<br />2020-03-05T15:59:12.899906+09:00 [switch01][ptmd][info] Free client connection fd[17] tot[0]<br /><br />To work around this issue, stop the netq-agent daemon. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28770 | The net add routing route-map &lt;name&gt; permit &lt;seq&gt; set community &lt;comm&gt; command does not add the set statement into the /etc/frr/frr.conf file. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28754 | On Trident2+ switches, adding SPAN rules disables PBR rules. | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28717 | On the Mellanox SN3800 switch, when you remove the PSU, smonctl reports that the PSU is BAD instead of ABSENT. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28714 | On the Mellanox SN3800 switch, when you remove a fan tray, smonctl reports that the fan is low instead of absent. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28705 | On the Mellanox SN3800 switch, 4x25G DAC breakouts are not supported. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28699 | On the EdgeCore AS5812 switch, when simpledeploy tries restarting switchd after updating the ports.conf file, switchd fails to start. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28657 | The BFD session to the NSX controller sometimes remains down. | 3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28656 | In OVSDB vlan-aware mode, removing a VTEP binding on the NSX controller fails to clean up all interfaces associated with the logical switch. | 3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28620 | On Mellanox SN3800 switches, the links do not come up when the ports are configured for 40G. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28613 | In EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environments, rebooting one member of an MLAG pair should result in the local MAC Mobility sequence number reverting to 0. Sometimes a reboot of one MLAG peer results in the local MAC Mobility sequence number being set to a non-zero value despite no further mobility events occurring. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28611 | In an EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environment, sometimes a local-to-remote MAC Mobility event results in the local sequence number appearing higher than the remote sequence number in zebra. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28497 | QinQ across VXLAN on a traditional bridge does not work. | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-28489 | The following CVE was announced for rsyslog:<br />CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042<br />rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br />Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.<br />The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28465 | When you try to configure link-down on a parent interface of a subinterface configured in a VRF, you encounter an error. | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28458 | You should not configure port security on bond/MLAG interfaces; however, NCLU allows this.<br />Port security is not supported on bond/MLAG interfaces.<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28340 | Mellanox switches with the Spectrum A0 ASIC that are integrated with VMware NSX experience BFD connectivity issues with service nodes. As a result, VXLAN tunnels do not work.<br />Mellanox switches with the Spectrum_A1 ASIC do *not* have this issue. | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28249 | On Mellanox switches, when you modify the buffer and queue configuration without restating switchd, you might see a one second interruption in forwarding. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28226 | When you restart the hsflowd service, you see a systemd warning message similar to the following:<br />Warning: The unit file, source configuration file or drop-ins of hsflowd&#64;mgmt.service changed on disk. Run 'systemctl daemon-reload'.<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28189 | When host-resources and ucd-snmp-mib are polled, you see permission denied messages similar to the following:<br />Jan 30 19:22:53 switch123 snmpd[23172]: Cannot statfs /sys/kernel/debug/tracing: Permission denied<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28184 | TACACS users are unable to execute sudo commands.<br />To work around this issue, add the tacacs0 user to the sudo group; for example:<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  usermod -a -G sudo tacacs0<br /><br />Alternatively, run the following command:<br />ip vrf exec default sudo -i<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28136 | The MLAG switch pair has VLANs defined that are not used on MLAG bonds, these VLANs still synchronize MAC addresses across to the peer switch. This results in log messages that indicate a MAC address is installed and the VLAN is not defined; for example:<br />RTM_NEWNEIGH with unconfigured vlan XXXX on port peerlink<br /> | 3.7.10-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28080 | TACACS+ through ClearPass is not currently supported. Cumulus Linux sends authorization before authentication, but ClearPass does not accept an authorization before the user is authenticated. | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28061 | On Trident3 switches, PFC is not working as expected. If you set the PFC for only one CoS,  pause frames are sent for all CoS traffic. | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-28003 | The FRR service does not provide a way for automation to know if the configuration applied properly.<br />To work around this issue, execute the vtysh -f &lt;file&gt; command in the automation file before starting the FRR service to validate the functional configuration and return an error code. | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27957 | If you have configured a higher number of ports and VLANs (ports x VLANs) or the switch is a lower-powered (CPU) platform, the switchd service might fail to send a systemd keepalive within the watchdog timeout value (2 minutes by default) and you see an error similar to the following:<br />bq. systemd[1]: switchd.service watchdog timeout (limit 2min)!<br /><br />To workaround this issue, either reduce the number of configured interfaces and/or VLANs or increase the systemd timeout for switchd.service.<br />To increase the systemd timeout:<br />	Edit the /etc/systemd/system/switchd.service.d/override.conf file and increase the WatchdogSec parameter.<br />	Restart the switchd service with the sudo systemctl restart switchd.service command.<br />systemd will attempt to restart the switchd service automatically (after the watchdog timeout). If the restart fails multiple times in a short time period, run the sudo systemctl reset-failed command followed by the sudo systemctl restart switchd command.<br /> | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27950 | On the Dell S5232F, S5248F, S5296F, and S3048 switches, using the poweroff or halt commands does not fully power off the switch. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27753 | The EdgeCore Minipack-AS8000 supports FEC RS by default; you cannot disable this setting. However, the ethtool --show-fec command output indicates that FEC is disabled. Also, if you try to change the FEC setting, Cumulus Linux reports an error. For example:<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link speed 100000<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link autoneg off<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  net add interface swp23 link fec rs<br />"/sbin/ifreload -a" failed:<br />error: swp23: cmd '/sbin/ethtool --set-fec swp23 encoding rs' failed: returned 255 (Cannot set FEC settings: Operation not supported)<br />Command '['/sbin/ifreload', '-a']' returned non-zero exit status 1<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27678 | The net show bridge macs command returns an empty interface column.<br />To work around this issue, run the bridge fdb show command to show the interface. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27642 | The following CVEs were announced that affect the libssh package:<br />CVE-2019-14889 has been announced in the libssh library, where unsanitized user-provided scp command lines could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.<br />The libssh library is not installed on Cumulus Linux by default, but is available in the Cumulus Linux 4 repository for optional installation. Note that libssh is distinct from libssh2 and openssh, which are present on the switches and in the repositories.<br />See the following for more information:<br />https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2019-14889.txt<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14889 | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27637 | On the EdgeCore Minipack-AS8000 switch, a 100G DAC link does not come up when auto-negotiation is enabled on the neighbor. This switch does not support 100G DAC auto-negotiation at this time. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27444 | If you use the NCLU commands to configure NTP and run the net add time ntp source &lt;interface&gt; command before you run the net add time ntp server &lt;server&gt; iburst command, the /etc/ntp.conf file is misconfigured.<br />To work around this issue, run the net add time ntp server &lt;server&gt; iburst command before you run the net add time ntp source &lt;interface&gt; command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-27254 | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum and Spectrum-2 ASIC, IPv6 egress ACLs are not supported on subinterfaces. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27243 | The length of the netlink message is not set properly for non-bridge family type messages. The same length is used for both bridge and non-bridge family type messages even though the bridge family type message has an extra attribute. This causes extra bytes to be left over in non-bridge family type netlink messages. | 3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-27143 | The CPU core temperature sensors are absent on the Dell S5248F-ON switch. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27136 | With a high number of active routes (20K or more), when you perform a networking restart, the FRR log files might become flooded with error messages associated with the restart. These logs are normal and are not directly a problem. However, the large number of messages can cause the logs to rotate away any previous history, which prevents you from tracing back events leading up to the restart. In a troubleshooting environment, this can be problematic. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27131 | On switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, SPAN and ERSPAN functionality is not supported. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27130 | On the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, you might see some entries in the INPUT chain for ebtables that do not match with the packets sent. For example, the packet count might show 0 while the expected count might be 100.     | 4.1.0 | |
| CM-27099 | Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is not currently supported on Mellanox switches with the Spectrum-2 ASIC.  | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27094 | On the Delta AG9032v1 switch, smonctl and sensors report inaccurate PSU current and power. | 3.5.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27081 | On the switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, if you configure more than 96 ports in a layer 2 bridge, switchd might hit a timeout error and restart.   | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-27018 | When more than one VRR interface is configured on an SVI interface, deleting one of the VRR addresses does not remove the interface/address.  | 3.7.10-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26942 | Port security is not currently supported on VX. The NCLU commands produce errors. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26921 | If you delete an undefined bond, then add a bond slave, the net commit command fails. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26913 | FRR configuration commands for an SVI interface might have the \n misplaced in the output.  For example:<br />sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50\nvrf TEST description L3 routing interface\n' &gt;&gt; /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /><br />should be:<br />sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50 vrf TEST\ndescription L3 routing interface\n' &gt;&gt; /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /><br />To work around this issue, configure the interface manually in the /etc/frr/frr.conf file. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26907 | NCLU incorrectly allows you to apply port security configuration on layer 2 and layer 3 ports that are not part of a bridge. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26905 | When you update the hostname of a switch with the NCLU net add hostname &lt;hostname&gt; command, then run net commit, the lldpd service is not restarted and other devices still see the old name.<br />To work around this issue, run the sudo systemctl restart lldpd.service command. | 3.7.10-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26875 | After deleting an IPv6 numbered BGP peer group neighbor, Cumulus Linux may continue to send RAs.  To address this, restart frr after removing IPv6 numbered configuration. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26860 | When you run the NCLU net show commit last command or net show commit &lt;number&gt; where &lt;number&gt; is the last commit, there is no output.  | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26769 | Setting ProtoDown on ports populated with SFP modules providing RJ-45 1000BASE-T interfaces does not cause the carrier to be dropped. The kernel shows carrier down; however, the remote device still shows a link. | 3.7.6-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26702 | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum-2 ASIC, policy-based routing (PBR) is not currently supported. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26655 | Reconfiguring an NTP server via NCLU with different trailing options (such as iburst) after the IP address causes an invalid configuration to be added to the /etc/ntp.conf file.  As an example<br />net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4 iburst<br />net commit<br />net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4<br />net commit<br /><br />If you need to alter existing server configurations, first remove the server, commit, then re-add the server with any trailing options. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26599 | Auto-negotiation does not work with the QSFP28 cables and a remote system opreating at 10G. Attempting to enable auto-negotiation via ethtool -s swp&lt;#&gt; autoneg on returns Operation not supported.<br />As a workaround, do not use auto-negotiation and set the local port speed to 10G. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26595 | The NCLU net show lldp command displays the speed of a ganged port group as the speed of one of the individual links, rather than the sum of their speeds. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26516 | Applying a policy-based routing (PBR) rule for all traffic from a host might disrupt ARP refresh for that connected host. | 3.7.5-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26423 | NCLU requires you to specify an interface with multiple address-virtual statements in ascending MAC address order. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26412 | Mac learning is not disabled by default on a double tagged peer link interface resulting in the MAC address flipping between the MLAG bond and the peer link.<br />To work around this issue, disable MAC learning on QinQ VLANs by adding bridge-learning off to the VLAN stanza in the etc/network/interfaces file. | 3.7.9-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26308 | An interface alias configured outside FRR using iproute2 is imported into the FRR running configuration and overrides the internal description. After an FRR reload, this causes FRR to delete the interface alias in an inefficient way. Depending on how many interfaces with aliases you have configured, this can cause a FRR reload to time out.<br />To work around this issue, remove the interface alias description from iproute2. | 3.7.8-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26288 | On Mellanox switches, static VXLAN tunnels incorrectly allow traffic from any remote tunnel IP address. | 3.7.8-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26256 | The net show evpn vni detail json command includes an extra empty dictionary at the end of the output. <br /> | 3.7.8-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26241 | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, smond may generate syslog messages indicating that the fan input RPM is lower than the normal low speed of 2500 RPM.  Speeds as low as 1700 RPM are acceptable in normal thermal environments and so these messages can be disregarded. | 3.7.6-3.7.11, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.12|
| CM-26217 | NCLU does not allow you to configure OSPF NSSAs. For example: <br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ net add ospf area 0.0.0.1 nssa <br />ERROR: Command not found. <br />net add ospf area 0.0.0.1 nssa<br /><br />To work around this issue, use FRR instead. For example: <br />switch# configure terminal <br />switch(config)# router ospf <br />switch(config-router)# area 0.0.0.1 nssa <br /> | 3.7.7-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26179 | If a hostname contains utf-8 characters, the NCLU net show lldp command outputs the following error: <br />ERROR: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in position 3: ordinal not in range(128) <br />See /var/log/netd.log for more details.  <br /> | 3.7.7-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-26139 | Selective ERSPAN does not work when you specify a bridge port. | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26138 | You cannot specify a source and destination MAC address in an ERSPAN ebtables rule. For example, the following rule does not work:<br />-A FORWARD -i swp5 -s 00:25:90:b2:bd:9d -d 50:6b:4b:96:c4:04 -j erspan --src-ip 100.1.1.2 --dst-ip 100.1.1.1 --ttl 64<br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26137 | ERSPAN in ebtables does not work for VNIs. For example, the following rule does not work:<br />-A FORWARD -i vni10 -j erspan --src-ip 100.1.1.2 --dst-ip 100.1.1.1 --ttl 64<br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26136 | In an ebtables rule, ERSPAN (upper case) does not work. You need to specify erspan (lower case). | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-26024 | On switches with the Spectrum ASIC, the underlay hashes VXLAN packets for a given overlay flow randomly.<br />To work around this issue, configure the ECMP hash seed to the same value on the EVPN egress leaf switches. | 3.7.7-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25986 | On the Mellanox Spectrum-2 switch, the time required to establish a link (from the time a link is set to admin up until the link becomes operationally up) can take up to 15 seconds on 40G interfaces and up to 30 seconds on 100G interfaces. <br />To work around this issue, wait up to 15 seconds on 40G interfaces and 30 seconds on 100G interfaces for the link to establish. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25890 | In some cases, the switchd service might warn of excessive MAC moves from one switch port to itself (for example, from swp18 to swp18). | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25859 | The MTU of an SVI cannot be higher than the MTU on the bridge. Changing the MTU on the SVI with NCLU does not update the bridge MTU. The net commit commands succeeds even though the MTU is not changed as expected.<br />To work around this issue, change the MTU on all SVIs and the bridge manually in the /etc/network/interfaces file, then apply the change with the ifreload -a command. | 3.7.7-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25815 | When an SVI with a virtual MAC is configured with a layer 2 VNI in an EVPN environment , if the /etc/network/interfaces file is replaced with a different file that does not have the SVI and layer 2 VNI configuration anymore, the original virtual MAC does not get populated through the EVPN route until FRR is restarted. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25766 | When you run the apt upgrade command on the Dell-N3048EP switch, the upgrade does not work. <br /> | 3.7.7-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25740 | On Broadcom Maverick switches with a QinQ configuration, the packets coming into the CPU might be tagged incorrectly; for example, 802.1ad + 802.1q tags are expected in the packets but the packets have 802.1q + 802.1q tags. <br />To work around this issue, configure the bridge with bridge-vlan-protocol 802.1ad: <br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ net add bridge mybridge vlan-protocol 802.1ad <br />  | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25694 | If a packet is policed by ebtables, it does not increment an ACL drop on the ingress interface. Instead, it increments the TDBGC3/6 drop counter to the CPU. | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25400 | If an SVI exists in the configuration before you assign it an IP address, when you do assign the IP address with the NCLU command, the vlan-id and the raw-device bridge stanzas are not added automatically. <br /> | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-25397 | When first creating a bond and enslaving an interface, NCLU hides some of the bridge command suggestions, although they are still accepted. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24894 | The maximum-prefix configuration under the IPv4 address family has an optional restart value which you can configure. This configuration is ignored and, instead of restarting the sessions every x minutes, the peer constantly changes between established and idle due to the prefix count being exceeded. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24803 | When you execute the following command on the Dell N3048EP-ON or the Delta AG6248C, the switch reboots and then comes right back into Cumulus Linux without installing the new image. The install image is still in /var/lib/cumulus/installer, which causes issues with cl-support. <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo onie-install -fai http://&lt;path to image&gt; <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo reboot <br /> <br /> <br />To work around this issue, use the onie-select command to access ONIE, and then use the nos-install command in ONIE to install a new binary image. <br />The workaround only works when an out-of-band network is present. | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24799 | On switches using the Trident2 ASIC, 802.1Q-encapsulated control plane traffic received on an interface with 802.1AD configured subinterfaces might be dropped. <br />This issue only affects QinQ configurations. <br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24762 | On the EdgeCore AS7326 switch, the 1000BASE-T SFP RJ-45 on a 25G port does not work at 1G. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-24751 | On the QuantaMesh T4048-IX8 or EdgeCore AS7326-56X switches, when using a 1000BASE-T SFP module, the module LEDs do not light to reflect link status.<br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24652 | In an EVPN environment, the centralized MAC address is not getting installed on the MLAG pair because Cumulus Linux does not perform an SVI MAC check per VLAN. <br /> This issue does not manifest itself in a pure distributed routing (symmetric or asymmetric) environment or in a pure centralized routing environment. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24618 | If the interface alias contains a single or double quotation mark, or an apostrophe, the net show configuration commands fail with the following error: <br /> <br /> <br /> ERROR: No closing quotation <br /> See /var/log/netd.log for more details. <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.6.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24473 | SNMP incorrectly requires engine ID specification. <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24435 | When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a match interface condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. <br /> For example, this command is incorrect: <br /> <br /> <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 <br /> <br /> <br /> These commands are correct: <br /> <br /> <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9 <br /> net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 30 match interface swp10 <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24426 | NCLU allows for the configuration of addresses on VRF interfaces, but tab completion for the net add vrf &lt;name&gt; command just displays &lt;ENTER&gt;. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ net add vrf mgmt <br /> &lt;ENTER&gt; <br /> <br /> <br /> Tab completion for the net add vrf &lt;name&gt; ip address &lt;address&gt; command works correctly. <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24379 | On Maverick switches, CPU forwarded packets might be dropped when there is no route to a leaked host route. | 3.7.5-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24343 | The net del bridge bridge mcsnoop yes command does not return the value to the default of disabled. <br />To work around this issue, use the net add bridge bridge mcsnoop no command to delete the mcsnoop attribute and return to the default value. | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24332 | On Broadcom switches, when moving configuration from bridged to routed (or toggling from routed to bridged to routed), some traffic is not seen by the kernel. This can cause BGP to not establish on a transit node. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24272 | When you try to configure the VRRP priority and advertisement-interval with NCLU on a traditional mode bridge, the net commit command fails. <br /> To work around this issue, use the vtysh command (inside FRR) to change the VRRP priority or advertisement-interval on traditional bridges. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface br0.100 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 priority 110 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 advertisement-interval <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24271 | On SVIs in a VLAN-aware bridge, you cannot change the VRRP priority with NCLU. <br /> To work around this issue, run the vtysh command inside FRR to change the default priority. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface vlan100 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 priority 110 <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24270 | Cumulus Linux uses VRRPv3 as the default version, and enables both preempt and accept mode by default. You cannot change these default values with NCLU. <br />To work around this issue, run the vtysh commands (inside FRR) to change the default values. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo vtysh <br /> switch# configure terminal <br /> switch(config)# interface swp4 <br /> switch(config-if)# vrrp 1 version 2 <br /> switch(config-if)# no vrrp 1 preempt <br /> switch(config-if)# end <br /> switch# write memory <br /> switch# exit <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~ <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.4-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24262 | NCLU does not honor "auto all" in the /etc/network/interfaces file and removes the existing configuration if no individual auto &lt;iface&gt; lines exist. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24241 | When you try to remove a BGP peer group configuration with NCLU, the command fails but no warning message is shown. For example: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ net del bgp neighbor fabric peer-group <br /> 'router bgp 65001' configuration does not have 'neighbor fabric peer-group' <br /> <br /> <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24222 | When an LDAP user that does not have NCLU privileges (either in the netshow or netedit group, or in the /etc/netd.conf file) runs an NCLU command, a traceback occurs instead of a permissions error. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-24035 | On the Edgecore 4610-54P switch, automatic medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) stops working on a 100M full duplex interface and does not detect the required cable connection type. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23825 | The net add interface &lt;interface&gt; ptm-enable command adds no ptm-enable for that interface in the frr.conf file. <br /> Running the net add or the net del command does not remove no ptm-enable from the frr.conf file. You have to remove it manually using vtysh. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23665 | NCLU automatically adds the VLAN ID (for the layer 3 VNI/SVI) to the bridge when using net add vxlan &#91;L3VNI&#93; bridge access &#91;VLAN&#93; <br />This configuration breaks network connectivity in an MLAG system in an EVPN symmetric routing configuration. <br />To restore connectivity, you need to remove the VLAN ID from the bridge. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23661 | When you configure a GRE tunnel on a Mellanox switch, the traffic behind the local tunnel endpoint destined through the GRE tunnel is software-forwarded. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23651 | In an EVPN symmetric routing configuration, when an IP address is frozen, kernel neighbor table information and kernel VRF routing table information about the frozen IP address might be out-of-sync. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23584 | When you configure a control plane ACL to define permit and deny rules destined to the local switch, NCLU programs the control plane ACL rules into the FORWARD chain. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23570 | On an RMP/1G-T switch, when you remove link-speed 100 with the NCLU command or by editing the etc/network/interfaces file to revert the 100M interface to the default (1G auto), the interface fails to recover and does not come back up.<br />After you remove the link-speed, ethtool shows the advertised link modes as not reported and Speed/Duplex as unknown.<br />To work around this issue and bring the interface back up, either restart switchd or use ethtool to configure the speed, advertised, duplex or MDI-X settings. <br />Note: The advertised link mode gets set incorrectly if you include 1000baseT/Half. The port will come up successfully at 1G. | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23418 | For QSFP modules, the sudo ifdown command does not disable the Tx laser. <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23417 | When using NCLU to create an ibgp peering across the peerlink, the addition of the net add bgp l2vpn evpn neighbor peerlink.4094 activate command creates a new EBGP neighborship when one has already been configured for IBGP. This is unexpected, the existing IBGP configuration is valid. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23311 | In an EVPN centralized routing configuration, where the layer 2 network extends beyond VTEPs, (for example, host with bridges), the gateway MAC address does not get refreshed in the network when ARP suppression is enabled on the gateway.<br />To work around this issue, disable ARP suppression on the centralized gateway. | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23075 | There is a limitation on the number of SVI interfaces you can specify as DHCP relay interfaces in the /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay file. For example, 1500 SVI interfaces causes the dhcrelay service to exit without a core file and logs similar to the following are generated for the interfaces: <br /> <br /> <br /> 2018-11-10T23:35:30.992370-08:00 Dev dhcrelay: Listening on LPF/vlan.101/a0:00:00:00:00:51 <br /> 2018-11-10T23:35:30.993472-08:00 Dev dhcrelay: Sending on LPF/vlan.101/a0:00:00:00:00:51 <br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually the dhcrelay service stops. <br /> | 3.7.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-23021 | When you run the mstpctl command, you might see the bridge-port state as blocking when it is actually disabled. You might see the same incorrect bridge-port state when other programs or tools use the output of mstpctl; for example, SNMP output from the BRIDGE-MIB. | 3.7.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22554 | If you try to bring down several members of a bond remotely at the same time, the link state of one of the interfaces might not transition correctly to the down state; however, all links show down in hardware. <br /> | 3.6.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22386 | The BFD packet redirection logic used by OVSDB server high availability mode redirects BUM packets across the peerlink. The iptables rule for redirection does differentiate between BFD and non-BFD VXLAN inner packets because the service node sends all frames with its own IP address as the tunnel source IP address. The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22301 | For an unresolved address, the IPROUTER default policer rule has been modified to not match on packets exiting a TUNNEL and headed to the CPU to resolve the address via ARP. As a result, the following default rule no longer matches TUNNEL ingress packets. <br /> <br /> <br /> A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -m addrtype --dst-type <br /> IPROUTER -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 400 --set-burst 100 <br /> <br /> <br /> These packets are now policed by catch all rules. <br /> To work around this issue, the VPORT value on a TRIDENT switch must be changed from binary 011 to 100. <br /> | 3.6.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22287 | When a layer 3 ECMP path is brought down on the EdgeCore AS7712 (Tomahawk) switch running in atomic mode, traffic traversing the path stops working for about four seconds. When the switch is changed to non-atomic mode, the delay is less than one second. This issue is seen across OSPF and static ECMP routes.  | 3.6.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22228 | Counters associated with VLANs and VRFs are not working on Trident 2+ switches. <br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22041 | At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues. This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in No buffer space available error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a switchd restart. | 3.4.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-22020 | On the Trident3 platform, static PIM with IIF based on a layer 2 bridge does not work reliably. PIM Join via signaling is required for IPMC to work properly.<br />To work around this issue, use dynamic signaling (joins) to manage IP multicast traffic. | 3.7.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21927 | When running ifreload after updating an interface configuration, sometimes VLANs are not programmed into the hardware data plane. The Linux control plane looks normal but the VLAN has not been programmed into the hardware and packets that arrive for the VLAN might be dropped. <br />To work around this issue, remove and re-add the affected VLANs from the port. <br /> | 3.5.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21785 | The source address of the ICMPv6 time exceeded message (traceroute hop) is sourced from the wrong VRF when the traceroute target resides on the same switch but in a different VRF. | 3.6.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21769 | On a Mellanox switch, GRE tunneling does not work if the tunnel source is configured on an SVI interface. If  the tunnel source is configured on a physical switch port, then tunneling works as expected. | 3.6.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21678 | On a Dell switch with a Maverick ASIC, NetQ might receive false alerts like the following via PagerDuty: <br /> <br /> <br /> cumulus&#64;switch:~$ netq show sensors temp changes \| grep absent \| grep -v psu <br /> P2Leaf01 temp9 networking asic die temp sensor absent 43 105 100 5 Unable to find driver path: /cumulu Add 7d:22h:1m:41s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 45 105 100 5 Unable to find driver path: /cumulu Add 7d:22h:1m:41s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 47 105 100 5 Unable to read temp4_highest Add 9d:23h:26m:6s <br /> P2Leaf01 temp6 networking asic die temp sensor absent 45 105 100 5 Unable to read temp4_highest Add 14d:22h:46m:45s <br /> <br /> <br /> This message might occur as a result of a timeout at the hardware level, or the switch might be reporting a failure to get a response. <br /> | 3.5.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21667 | FRR does not add BGP ttl-security to either the running configuration or to the /etc/frr/frr.conf file when configured on a peer group instead of a specific neighbor. <br />To work around this issue, add ttl-security to individual neighbors instead of the peer group. | 3.6.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-21278 | The net show lldp command sometimes shows the port description in the Remote Port field. The net show interface command shows the correct value in the Remote Host field.<br />To work around this issue, use net show interface command for LLDP output when connected to Cisco equipment. | 3.5.3-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| CM-21055 | On Mellanox switches, the destination MAC address of ERSPAN GRE packets is set to all zeros; therefore, the packets might be dropped by the first transit switch. | 3.6.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-20813 | Span rules matching the out-interface as a bond do not mirror packets. | 3.6.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-20508 | The Cumulus-Resource-Query-MIB defines the ability to gather buffer utilization status but when these objects are polled, they return nothing.  | 3.5.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-20033 | The VLAN interface stays up even though the physical link carrying the VLAN is admin or carrier down.<br /> | 3.5.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-19724 | PIM and MSDP entries are set to the internal COS value of 6 so they are grouped together with the bulk traffic priority group in the default traffic.conf file. However, PIM, IGMP, and MSDP are considered control-plane and should be set to the internal COS value of 7.  | 3.5.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-19454 | When you use NCLU to bring a bond admin down (net add bond &lt;bond&gt; link down), the bond interface goes into admin down state but the switch ports enslaved to the bond remain UP. If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br />To work around this issue, use the sudo ifdown &lt;bondname&gt; command. | 3.5.0-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-17934 | FRR tracks interface speed based on the value it learns from the Linux kernel for that interface. If the interface speed changes, FRR does not update its interface speed cache. This can lead to issues for routing protocols that derive metrics from interface speed as the cost can become out of sync with the interface speed.<br />To work around this issue, manually define the routing protocol metric for these interfaces or restart FRR. | 3.7.6-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-17494 | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br />To work around this issue, change the value of arp_ignore to 2. See Default ARP Settings in Cumulus Linux for more information. | 3.3.2-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-16571 | NCLU cannot manage rsyslog to addresses routed via a VRF.  In Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and later, management VRF is enabled by default.   To work around this issue, update the /etc/network/interfaces file to disable management VRF. | 3.4.3-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| CM-15812 | Multicast forwarding fails for IP addresses whose DMAC overlaps with reserved DIPs. | 3.2.1-3.7.12, 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |

|  Bug ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|
|---	        |---	        |---	    |
| CM-28658 | The OVSDB log contains duplicate MAC addresses with the well-known BFD MAC address (00:23:20:00:00:01). This is mainly cosmetic, but clutters the log. | 3.7.12-4.0.0 | |
| CM-28655 | When you remove, then re-add an NSX VTEP binding, the VXLAN VTEP interface is not recreated. | 3.6.1-4.0.0 | |
| CM-28609 | On the Delta AG9032v1 switch, swp5 does not link up using 100G SR4 modules.<br />To work around this issue, use a different port for 100G SR4 modules. |  | |
| CM-28533 | On the Lenovo NE0152T switch, one power supply (PSU2) always show as ABSENT in smonctl. | 3.7.11-4.0.0 | |
| CM-28510 | The following vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.<br />CVE-2019-5481: Thomas Vegas discovered a double-free in the FTP-KRB code, triggered by a malicious server sending a very large data block.<br />CVE-2019-5482: Thomas Vegas discovered a heap buffer overflow that could be triggered when a small non-default TFTP blocksize is used.<br />Vulnerable: 7.64.0-4<br />Fixed: 7.64.0-4+deb10u1 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28372 | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X switch, the default fan speed, which is defined in the thermal specification, results in excessive fan noise. | 3.7.11-4.0.0 | |
| CM-28331 | When you add a route map to {advertise ipv4 unicast in a BGP EVPN configuration and the route-map contains a set operation, BGP crashes. | 3.7.11-4.0.0 | |
| CM-28313 | On the EdgeCore Wedge100 and Facebook Wedge-100S switch, certain physical ports are not correctly mapped to the logical ones. For example:<br />Logical swp39 controls physical swp41<br />Logical swp40 controls physical swp42<br />Logical swp43 controls physical swp45<br />Logical swp44 controls physical swp46<br />This might causes incorrect forwarding behavior. | 3.7.11, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28276 | When a Trident3 switch receives packets containing an IP checksum value that is not compliant with RFC 1624, the TTL is decremented after a routing operation but the checksum is not recalculated. This results in the IP checksum value being invalid as the packet leaves the switch.  | 3.7.10-3.7.11, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28221 | The following security vulnerabilities have been announced in qemu, which is not installed by default on Cumulus Linux but is available in the repository for optional installation:<br />CVE-2019-15890 CVE-2020-7039 CVE-2020-1711: security issues have been found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU, a fast processor emulator, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/qemu<br />Vulnerable: &lt;= 3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u3<br />Fixed: 3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u4 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28218 | The following security vulnerability affects libidn2, which is installed by default on Cumulus Linux:<br />CVE-2019-18224: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the idn2_to_ascii_4i() function in libidn2, the GNU library for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), which could result in denial of service, or the execution of arbitrary code when processing a long domain string. For more information, see:<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libidn2<br />https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18224<br />Vulnerable: 2.0.5-1<br />Fixed: 2.0.5-1+deb10u1 | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28200 | The Mellanox SN3700C switch encounters a memory leak after you apply an EVPN and PIM configuration. | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-28169 | On the Dell Z9264F-ON switch, the CPU core temperature sensors report ABSENT. | 3.7.11, 4.0.0 | |

| CM-27586 | CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br />To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /><br />Note: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br />To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<br />	If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).<br />	Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.<br /> | 3.7.11-4.0.0 | |
| CM-27547 | Trident2+ switches do not enable DFE for 10G and 4x10G DACs.

| CM-26158 | On Mellanox switches, UFT profiles are unable to support the documented capacity for routes to addresses that are more than 64 bits in length. The listed capacities assume 64-bit destination IP addresses. | 3.7.8-3.7.10, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-25693 | After you issue the NCLU net del bgp vrf &lt;vrf&gt; autonomous-system &lt;AS&gt; command and commit the change, Cumulus Linux does not remove the configuration from the /etc/frr/frr.conf file or the net show config commands. <br /> | 3.7.3-3.7.10, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-25665 | On Broadcom Trident 3 switches, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:<br />	VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.<br />	VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack.<br /><br />To work around this issue, either:<br />	Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)<br />	Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)<br /> | 3.7.5-3.7.11, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-25641 | If the BMC operating system fails to respond to IPMI, you see a traceback in bmcd and all the sensors might report ABSENT devices in smonctl. <br />To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. <br /> | 3.7.6-4.0.0 | |
| CM-25505 | During the bring-up sequence following a reboot, VXLAN routed packets (tenant traffic flows) transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the clagd init-delay timer expires. <br />The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd. To route the tenant traffic flows, the kernel must perform address resolution but has to wait for the clagd init-delay timer to expire before the bonds can forward traffic. During the time when the ARP entry is unresolved, packets might be dropped. <br />During the init-delay period, the ARP cache is not yet populated so the problem exists until either the init-delay timer expires or clagd neighbor synchronization is complete. By default the clagd init-delay timer is set to 10 seconds and clagd neighbor synchronization occurs halfway through the init-delay period. Traffic resumes forwarding after one of the two criteria described above are met. <br />You might see this issue in EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link. <br />To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br />In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: <br /> <br />ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ <br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 <br />match as-path MY_ASN <br />set as-path prepend 4200000101 <br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20 <br />  | 3.7.6-3.7.10, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-24993 | When you try to change the NTP time zone with the NCLU net add time zone &lt;timezone&gt; command or by editing the /etc/timezone file manually, the configuration does not take effect.<br />To work around this issue, change the time zone with the sudo timedatectl set-timezone &lt;timezone&gt; command. For example:<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone US/Eastern<br /> | 4.0.0 | |
| CM-23397 | On Broadcom switches, when a link-local multicast frame is received on an access port with a VNI in the bridge, two copies of the packet are sent across the VNI to remote VTEPs and the receiving hosts observe duplicate packets. <br /> | 3.6.2-4.0.0 | |
| CM-22794 | The Dell S5048F-ON switch (with reverse airflow, rear to front), shows the Temp-3 sensor as absent. <br /> | 3.6.2-4.0.0 | |
| CM-22591 | CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br />To work around this issue, create a file called /etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf and add these settings:<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144<br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.11, 4.0.0 | |
| CM-22277 | In Cumulus Linux 3.7.10 and earlier, on Broadcom switches with the Trident3 ASICs, the ECN-CE bit is set by default on transit traffic. This might result in hosts adjusting traffic behavior if they are configured for the ECN feature. <br />In Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, the default behavior has changed; the ECN-CE bit is no longer set by default on transit traffic.  | 3.7.3-3.7.10 | |
| CM-21898 | On a Trident 3 switch, IGMP packets are not getting policed by the police rule in the 00control ACL file. The packets are policed by the catchall policer in the 99control ACL file instead. <br /> -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100 <br /> To work around this issue, let the CPU bound IGMP packet hit the following rule and change the policer rate to a desired value for IGMP packets: <br /> -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100 <br /> Typically, the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx is used only for PIM/IGMP control and data stream packets. However, this workaround cannot handle data stream multicast packets that are not TCP/UDP; this is not typically done. <br /> | 3.6.2-4.0.0 | |
| CM-19788 | If you configure a VLAN under a VLAN-aware bridge and create a subinterface of the same VLAN on one of the bridge ports, the bridge and interface compete for the same VLAN and if the interface is flapped, it stops working. Correcting the configuration and running the ifreload command does not resolve the conflict. <br />To work around this issue, correct the bridge VIDs and restart switchd or delete the subinterface.  | 3.5.0-4.0.0 | |
| CM-18727 | On the Mellanox SN-2100 switch, unicast packets are counted in multicast queue counters. | 3.4.3-3.7.10 | |
