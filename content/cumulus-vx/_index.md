Welcome to Cumulus Linux VX.

## What is Cumulus VX?

Cumulus VX is a free virtual environment designed for cloud and network administrators that introduces you to open networking where you can learn and test the latest technology from Cumulus Networks in your own time, at your own pace, and within your own environment, without organizational and economic barriers. Use Cumulus VX to produce sandbox environments for prototype assessment, pre-production rollouts, and script development. Refer to the {{<link url="Overview" text="Cumulus VX overview">}} for additional information about Cumulus VX, to see a list of the supported platforms, and to read the support policy.

## How do I use Cumulus VX?

This document describes how to install Cumulus VX on {{<link url="Overview" text="supported platforms">}} and configure the created VMs using a simple two leaf and one spine topology. After you successfully install and configure the VMs, you can run basic commands to get up and running. You can then explore further using the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux" text="Cumulus Linux documentation">}} as a resource.

The {{<link url="Advanced-Configuration" text="Advanced Configuration">}} section of this document provides additional procedures to configure the two leaf, one spine topology for use with the self-paced labs in the {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/lp/cumulus-linux-on-demand/" text="Virtual Test Drive">}} and to create your own topology with the topology converter for use with Vagrant and Libvirt.
