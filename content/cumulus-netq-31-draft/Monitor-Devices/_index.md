With the NetQ UI and CLI, a user can monitor the network inventory of switches and hosts, including such items as the number of each and what operating systems are installed. Additional details are available about the hardware and software components on switches, such as  the motherboard, ASIC, microprocessor, disk, memory, fan and power supply information.

- What switches do I have in the network?
- What is the distribution of ASICs across my network?
- Do all switches have valid licenses?
- Are NetQ agents running on all of my switches?
- What hardware is installed on my switches?
- How many transmit and receive packets have been dropped?
- How healthy are the fans and power supply?
