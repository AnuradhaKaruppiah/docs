NetQ supports a set of events that are triggered by crossing a user-defined threshold. These events allow detection and prevention of network failures for selected interface, utilization, and sensor events.

### Supported Events

The following events are supported:

| Category | Event ID | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Resource Utilization | TCA_CPU_UTILIZATION_UPPER | CPU utilization (%) greater than maximum threshold |
| Resource Utilization | TCA_DISK_UTILIZATION_UPPER  |  Disk utilization (%) greater than maximum threshold |
| Resource Utilization | TCA_MEMORY_UTILIZATION_UPPER  |  Memory utilization (%) greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_RXBROADCAST_UPPER  |  rx_broadcast bytes per second greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_RXBYTES_UPPER |  rx_bytes per second greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_RXMULTICAST_UPPER |  rx_multicast per second greater than maximum threshold |
| Sensors | TCA_SENSOR_FAN_UPPER  |  Switch sensor reported fan speed greater than maximum threshold |
| Sensors | TCA_SENSOR_POWER_UPPER|  Switch sensor reported power (Watts) greater than maximum threshold |
| Sensors | TCA_SENSOR_TEMPERATURE_UPPER  |  Switch sensor reported temperature (&deg;C) greater than maximum threshold |
| Sensors | TCA_SENSOR_VOLTAGE_UPPER  |  Switch sensor reported voltage (Volts) greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_TXBROADCAST_UPPER |  tx_broadcast bytes per second greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_TXBYTES_UPPER     |  tx_bytes per second greater than maximum threshold |
| Interface Statistics | TCA_TXMULTICAST_UPPER |  tx_multicast bytes per second greater than maximum threshold |

A notification configuration must contain one rule. Each rule must contain a scope and a threshold. Optionally, you can specify an associated channel.  **Note**: If a rule is not associated with a channel, the event information is only reachable from the database. If you want to deliver events to one or more notification channels (syslog, Slack, or PagerDuty), create them by following the instructions in [Create Your Channel](#create-your-channel), and then return here to define your rule.

### Define a Scope

A scope is used to filter the events generated by a given rule. Scope values are set on a per TCA rule basis. Scope parameters must be entered in the order defined.

| Event ID | Scope Parameters |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| TCA_CPU_UTILIZATION_UPPER | Hostname |
| TCA_DISK_UTILIZATION_UPPER  |  Hostname |
| TCA_MEMORY_UTILIZATION_UPPER  |  Hostname |
| TCA_RXBROADCAST_UPPER  |  Hostname, Interface |
| TCA_RXBYTES_UPPER |  Hostname, Interface |
| TCA_RXMULTICAST_UPPER |  Hostname, Interface |
| TCA_SENSOR_FAN_UPPER  |  Hostname, Sensor Name |
| TCA_SENSOR_POWER_UPPER|  Hostname, Sensor Name |
| TCA_SENSOR_TEMPERATURE_UPPER  |  Hostname, Sensor Name |
| TCA_SENSOR_VOLTAGE_UPPER  |  Hostname, Sensor Name |
| TCA_TXBROADCAST_UPPER |  Hostname, Interface |
| TCA_TXBYTES_UPPER  |  Hostname, Interface |
| TCA_TXMULTICAST_UPPER |  Hostname, Interface |

Scopes are defined with regular expressions, as follows. When two paramaters are used,they are separated by a comma, but no space. 

| Parameters | Scope Value | Example | Result |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Hostname | \<hostname> | leaf01 | Deliver events for the specified device |
| Hostname | \<partial-hostname>\* | leaf\* | Deliver events for devices with hostnames starting with specified text (*leaf*) |
| Hostname | \* | \* | Deliver events for all devices |
| Hostname, Interface | \<hostname>,\<interface> | leaf01,swp9 | Deliver events for the specified interface (*swp9*) on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Interface | \<hostname>,\* | leaf01,\* | Deliver events for all interfaces on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Interface | \*,\<interface> | \*,swp9 | Deliver events for the specified interface (*swp9*) on all devices |
| Hostname, Interface | \*,\* | \*,\* | Deliver events for all devices and all interfaces |
| Hostname, Interface | \<partial-hostname>\*,\<interface> | leaf*,swp9 | Deliver events for the specified interface (*swp9*) on all devices with hostnames starting with the specified text (*leaf*) |
| Hostname, Interface | \<hostname>,\<partial-interface>\* | leaf01,swp* | Deliver events for all interface with names starting with the specified text (*swp*) on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Sensor Name | \<hostname>,\<sensorname> | leaf01,fan1 | Deliver events for the specified sensor (*fan1*) on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Sensor Name | \*,\<sensorname> | \*,fan1 | Deliver events for the specified sensor (*fan1*) for all devices |
| Hostname, Sensor Name |  \<hostname>,\* | leaf01,* | Deliver events for all sensors on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Sensor Name | \<partial-hostname>\*,\<interface> | leaf*,fan1 | Deliver events for the specified sensor (*fan1*) on all devices with hostnames starting with the specified text (*leaf*) |
| Hostname, Sensor Name | \<hostname>,\<partial-sensorname>\* | leaf01,fan* | Deliver events for all sensors with names starting with the specified text (*fan*) on the specified device (*leaf01*) |
| Hostname, Sensor Name | \*,\* | \*,\* | Deliver events for all sensors on all devices |
