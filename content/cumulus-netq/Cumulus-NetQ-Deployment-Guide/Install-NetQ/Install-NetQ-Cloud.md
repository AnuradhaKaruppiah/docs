This topic describes the preparation steps needed before installing  NetQ in a cloud deployment.  Refer to [Prepare for NetQ On-premises Installation](../Install-NetQ/Prepare-NetQ-Onprem/) for preparations for on-premises deployments.

There are three key steps in the preparation for on-premises installation:

1. Decide whether you want to install NetQ using:
    - a virtual machine (VM) on hardware that you provide (the NetQ Platform), or
    - the Cumulus NetQ Appliance.

2. Review the general requirements and, if appropriate, the VM requirements.

3. Obtain the various software components and setup the VM or appliance.
