In general, installation of NetQ 2.4.0 requires a fresh installation. Refer to [Install NetQ](../Install-NetQ) for details. You can, however, retain your data from a prior version by backing up that data before you install the new software and restoring it after the new software is fully installed. Refer to [Backup and Restore NetQ](../Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Backup-and-Restore/) for details.

For those with a Cumulus NetQ Appliance or Cumulus NetQ Cloud Appliance, you can upgrade to the new software only after removing the Cumulus Linux OS and re-imaging the appliance with Ubuntu 18.04. Details are included in the [next section](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-a-NetQ-Hardware-Appliance/).
