If you installed Cumulus NetQ 2.4.0 *prior* to January 24, 2020, then Cumulus recommends that you perform an update to prevent a potential memory issue with the NetQ Agent.

For those with a Cumulus NetQ Appliance or Cumulus NetQ Cloud Appliance, you can upgrade to the new software only after removing the Cumulus Linux OS and re-imaging the appliance with Ubuntu 18.04. Details are included in the [next section](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-a-NetQ-Hardware-Appliance/).

If you installed the NetQ 2.4.0 Agent prior to January 24, 2020, you may need to upgrade the Agent to avoid a potential memory issue. Refer to the relevant OS Install NetQ Agent topic in [Install NetQ](../../Install-NetQ/).
