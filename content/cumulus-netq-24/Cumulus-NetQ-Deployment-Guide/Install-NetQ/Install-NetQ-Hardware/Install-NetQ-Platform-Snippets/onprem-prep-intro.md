This topic describes the preparation steps needed before installing the NetQ components *on your premises*.  Refer to {{<link title="Prepare for NetQ Cloud Installation">}} for preparations for cloud deployments.

There are three key steps in the preparation for on-premises installation:

1. Decide whether you want to install the NetQ Platform on:
    - a virtual machine (VM) on hardware that you provide, or
    - the Cumulus NetQ Appliance.

2. Review the VM requirements if you have chosen that option.

3. Obtain the NetQ Platform image and setup the VM or appliance.
