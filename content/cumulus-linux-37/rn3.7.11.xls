<td>The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.

CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.&lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).&lt;br/&gt;

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.&lt;br/&gt;
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\&lt;br/&gt;
The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.</td>

CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).&lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).&lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. &lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.&lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.&lt;br/&gt;
CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e.</td>

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv&lt;/a&gt;). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. &lt;br/&gt;
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd


&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.&lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.&lt;/li&gt;

<td>On the Delta AG-6248C PoE switch, when you run the apt upgrade command, the upgrade does not work. Cumulus Linux uses uboot directly instead of grub to boot the kernel. Uboot needs a special header to boot the kernel, which is not present. Without this header, when you use the apt upgrade command to upgrade Linux packages, uboot is unable to boot up the kernel. &lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the disk image. Run the onie-select command to go into ONIE, and then use the nos-install command in ONIE to install a new binary image.&lt;br/&gt;

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.&lt;br/&gt;
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. &lt;br/&gt;
In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: 

 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101 
route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20

<td>The following CVEs were announced in a Debian Security Advisory that affects vim modelines. &lt;br/&gt;
 Package: vim and neovim &lt;br/&gt;
 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 &lt;br/&gt;
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 &lt;br/&gt;
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. &lt;br/&gt;

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. &lt;br/&gt;
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: &lt;br/&gt;
 :set modeline? &lt;br/&gt;
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: 
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
 modeline is enabled by default. &lt;br/&gt;
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</td>

&lt;ul&gt;
