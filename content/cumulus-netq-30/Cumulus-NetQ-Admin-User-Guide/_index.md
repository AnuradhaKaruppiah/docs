As an administrator, you must secure, configure, and manage Cumulus NetQ. Tasks associated with these responsibilities are grouped into two categories:

- {{<link title="Application Management">}}: manage access to and various application-wide settings for the Cumulus NetQ UI from a single location
- {{<link title="Lifecycle Management">}}: manage deployment and operational tasks for Cumulus Linux and NetQ products

The NetQ UI makes both of these tasks easier than ever.
