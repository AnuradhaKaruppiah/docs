As an administrator, you must secure, configure, and manage your network hardware and software. Tasks associated with managing your physical hardware (switches) and virtual machines (VMs), Cumulus Linux and Cumulus NetQ software are described in this document. These responsibilities are grouped into two categories:

- {{<link title="Application Management">}}: manage access to and various application-wide settings for the Cumulus NetQ UI from a single location
- {{<link title="Lifecycle Management">}}: manage deployment and perform operational tasks for Cumulus Linux and Cumulus NetQ products from the NetQ UI or CLI
