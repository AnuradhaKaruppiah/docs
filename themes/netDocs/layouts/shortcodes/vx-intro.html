<p>In the toplogy, <strong>Leaf01</strong> and <strong>Leaf02</strong> are the access layer switches on the network. Leaf01</strong> and <strong>Leaf02</strong> connect to <strong>Spine01</strong>, which is the aggregation layer switch on the network.</p>

To facilitate additional configuration you can perform after the initial setup descibed in this guide, the topology also shows that Leaf01</strong> and <strong>Leaf02</strong> have two connections between each other.

<p>Follow the steps below to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create three VMs (Leaf01, Leaf02, and Spine01)</li>
